# toDo_app

## Description

A to do application that allows a user to add a todo on the screen. When the the todo is completed the user can left click the todo to put a line-through it and mark it as done. The todos persist if when the user closes the browser. This functionality is acheived through the use of local storage in the browser. A right click on the todo will completly delete that todo from the DOM and also from local storage.
